      <title>A Call to Chapel with Rev. Eboni Marshall Turman, Ph.D. at Cramton Auditorium</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<div>  <img src="https://localist-images.azureedge.net/photos/51874425067063/huge/1c1fc38527b3521f3f6272cb6692f91ccda1d7d0.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />  <div style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;"><strong>Sun, 01 Feb 2026</strong></div>  <div><p>The Reverend Eboni Marshall Turman, Ph.D. is the associate professor of theology, African American religion, and African American studies at Yale University Divinity School in New Haven, CT. A first-career concert dancer and ordained National Baptist preacher, her research interests span the varieties of twentieth and twenty-first century US theological liberalisms, most especially Black and womanist theological, social ethical, and theo-aesthetic traditions.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>An uncompromising race woman of faith, she co-chairs the Black Theology unit of the American Academy of Religion, is a founding member of the Black Church Collective, Brooklyn, NY, for which she served as lead author of “On Black Lives Matter: A Theological Statement from the Black Churches,” a viral missive that mobilized over one thousand Black pastors throughout the United States and documented the moral standpoint of the prophetic Black Churches in response to the January 6th Insurrection, and formerly served on the executive committee of the Society for the Study of Black Religion.</p>
