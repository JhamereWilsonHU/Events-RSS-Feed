Daughtry is a nationally recognized organizer-activist, political strategist, author, and Faith leader.  The daughter of a long line of community organizers and activists, Leah represents the fifth consecutive generation of pastors in the Daughtry family.  A consummate servant-leader, Leah describes her ability to create calm out of chaos as a God-given gift; and everything she has accomplished is a reflection of that gifting.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Standing at the intersection of Faith and politics, she works with community activists and organizations, political entities, businesses, and faith leaders and communities to assist them in building coalitions and partnerships that advance the common good.  For her work with and within communities of Faith, Religion News Service named her one of the 12 most influential Democrats in the nation on faith and values politics.  She has also served as Resident Fellow at Harvard University’s Institute of Politics, where she focused on the role faith and values play in American politics.</p>
