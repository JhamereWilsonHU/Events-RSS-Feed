      <title>A Call to Chapel with The Honorable Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, Ph.D. at Cramton Auditorium</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<div>  <img src="https://localist-images.azureedge.net/photos/50500455831515/huge/b32564b72cf4e75116f034203c0b6e22c72dbae7.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />  <div style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;"><strong>Sun, 28 Sep 2025</strong></div>  <div><p>The Honorable Reverend Dr. Raphael Gamaliel Warnock serves as the Senior Pastor of the Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, spiritual home of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the junior United States Senator from Georgia. The son of two Pentecostal pastors, Dr. Warnock responded to the call of ministry at a very early age, and at age 35, became the fifth and the youngest person ever called to the senior pastorate of Ebenezer Baptist Church, founded in 1886. Before coming to EBC, “America’s Freedom Church,” Dr. Warnock was blessed to study and serve within the pastoral ranks of leading congregations also known for their deep spiritual roots and strong public witness. Under Dr. Warnock’s leadership, the church continues its legacy of social activism with both spiritual and numerical growth.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Dr. Warnock graduated from Morehouse College cum laude in 1991, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology. He also holds a Master of Divinity degree from Union Theological Seminary in New York City, from which he graduated with honors and distinctions. Seeing his pastoral work as tied to the ministry of scholarship and the life of the mind, Dr. Warnock continued his graduate studies at Union, receiving a Master of Philosophy degree and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in the field of systematic theology. He has also received honorary degrees from The Morehouse School of Medicine, Fisk University and the University of the Virgin Islands. Dr. Warnock is an Ascend Fellow at The Aspen Institute, a Senior Fellow at Auburn Theological Seminary and a graduate of the Summer Leadership Institute of Harvard University and Leadership Atlanta.</p>

Taking place September 30 – October 2, 2025, the festival gathers writers, scholars, critics, and artists from across the African diaspora for three days of dynamic programming.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>See further below on this page for full schedule. All panels are in-person and will also be livestreamed at msrc.howard.edu/livestream</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This year’s theme — “The Story of Us” — centers Black fiction and explores how storytelling shapes identity, history, and imagination across generations and geographies. Through panels, readings, workshops, and student showcases, the festival will highlight the power of narrative as a tool for liberation, representation, and memory.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This year’s featured guests include award-winning author Jacqueline Woodson, literary critic and editor Clarence Haynes, historical romance icon Beverly Jenkins, bestselling novelist Kristina Forrest, acclaimed playwright and screenwriter Tanya Barfield, and multi-hyphenate artist and cultural producer LeeAnet Noble — with more to be announced.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Hosted by the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center and supported by campus and community partners, the festival also features a live book festival on the Yard, offering readers the opportunity to connect with authors, browse books by Black writers, and celebrate literature in the heart of Howard’s campus.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The International Black Writers Festival is free and open to the public, with select sessions streamed online. Whether you're a lifelong reader, emerging writer, or simply passionate about the power of Black storytelling, we invite you to join us in shaping and celebrating “The Story of Us.”</p>
