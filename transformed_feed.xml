      <title>National Harbor Jack &amp; Jill x HU School of Education MLK College Readiness Day of Service at Miner Building (Myrtilla Miner Building- School of Education)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<div>  <img src="https://localist-images.azureedge.net/photos/51756199417276/huge/426e0bd97926984bdd63727f661de665ff5fd19d.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />  <div style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;"><strong>Mon, 19 Jan 2026</strong></div>  <div><p>The Howard University School of Education, in partnership with the National Harbor Chapter (NHC) of Jack and Jill, is proud to host the 2026 MLK Day of Service, continuing a cherished tradition of community engagement, youth empowerment, and collective service in honor of the enduring legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. This event is FREE and OPEN to the PUBLIC.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The day will begin with a complimentary continental breakfast, followed by a warm welcome from the NHC Chapter President and the Howard University Interim Provost, and an opening prayer to set a reflective and purposeful tone. The program will feature a keynote presentation by Dr. Shawn Joseph, Interim Superintendent of Prince George’s County Public Schools, who will highlight college readiness initiatives and share insights on the wide range of academic and career-preparation opportunities available to middle and high school students across the district.</p>

<p>The program will then transition into a dynamic panel discussion for parents focused on financial planning and resources to support families in preparing for the cost of college, particularly in light of the evolving federal financial-aid landscape. While parents are in, children will engage in one of three thoughtfully designed breakout sessions, each tailored to support students and families at different developmental stages:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>College Readiness for High School Students, led by Howard University undergraduate studentsGavel Club / Speech Preparation Workshop for middle school students, exploring the principles of public speaking through the words and leadership of Dr. KingThe MLK “I Have a Dream” Room, where younger children will create MLK-inspired thank-you cards for teachers at Howard University Middle School </p>

<p>In addition to these learning experiences, youth volunteers will lead hands-on service projects, including assembling school-supply boxes for Howard University Middle School and stocking the snack pantry at the Howard University School of Education to support college students with nutritious study snacks.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Through education, service, and intergenerational collaboration, the 2026 NHC MLK Day of Service will once again create meaningful impact while honoring Dr. King’s vision of service, unity, and opportunity for all.</p>
