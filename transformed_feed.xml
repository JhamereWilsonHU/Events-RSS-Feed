      <title>Royal Court Coronation | Homecoming 2025 at Cramton Auditorium</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<div>  <img src="https://localist-images.azureedge.net/photos/49161539421202/huge/6f2a67907cda9f2119f581c337435df9a0f62d6d.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />  <div style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;"><strong>Sun, 19 Oct 2025</strong></div>  <div><p>Celebrate the crowning of Mister  and Miss Howard  University and the Royal Court, as students showcase the depth and breadth of their talent and leadership.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>For decades, Howard University’s Royal Coronation has been the envy of Homecomings across the country, as Mister and Miss Howard are installed as the official campus king and queen. Their court and others pay homage to the new campus royalty, and the most talented members of the campus community inspire and entertain through incredible performances.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Howard University’s Royal Coronation is much more than a display of pomp and circumstance. Mister and Miss Howard are the embodiment of the brilliance, boldness, creativity, and promise of the student body. It blends the pageantry of a regal ceremony with the style and cultural trendsetting unique to Howard. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It is a rite of ascendancy in the spirit of leadership and service imbued in every Howard student. As coronation begins the official reign of Mister and Miss Howard University, it symbolizes the beginning of the fulfillment of the global leadership roles destined for all Bison as they step into their respective fields. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Don’t miss your chance to witness the beginning of history at one of Howard University’s most fabled events. </p>

<p>"One of One: Howard University Homecoming 2025" will showcase the many ways the university is in a category of its own. Unique among the world’s colleges and universities, Howard has often stood alone as one of one— either as the only, the first, or at the top. The theme recognizes the fearlessness with which Howard has pursued truth and service since 1867, the relentlessness with which it pursues it today, and the invention with which it will lead in the future. “One of One” also references unity among all members of the Howard community in the perpetuation of the Howard legacy as we celebrate the 101st anniversary of Howard's Homecoming.</p>

Unique among the world’s colleges and universities, Howard has often stood alone as one of one— either as the only, the first, or at the top. The theme recognizes the fearlessness with which Howard has pursued truth and service since 1867, the relentlessness with which it pursues it today, and the invention with which it will lead in the future. “One of One” also references unity among all members of the Howard community in the perpetuation of the Howard legacy as we celebrate the 101st anniversary of Howard's Homecoming.</p>
