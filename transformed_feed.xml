<p>"One of One: Howard University Homecoming 2025" will showcase the many ways the university is in a category of its own. Unique among the world’s colleges and universities, Howard has often stood alone as one of one— either as the only, the first, or at the top. The theme recognizes the fearlessness with which Howard has pursued truth and service since 1867, the relentlessness with which it pursues it today, and the invention with which it will lead in the future. “One of One” also references unity among all members of the Howard community in the perpetuation of the Howard legacy as we celebrate the 101st anniversary of Howard's Homecoming.</p>
