      <title>A Call to Chapel with Rev. Dr. Howard-John Wesley at Cramton Auditorium</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<div>  <img src="https://localist-images.azureedge.net/photos/51874485568412/huge/74370245f8ef1831e41a151b49ec367e046f02ca.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />  <div style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;"><strong>Sun, 08 Feb 2026</strong></div>  <div><p>Rev. Dr. Howard-John Wesley is the exciting, gifted and anointed Senior Pastor of the historic Alfred Street Baptist Church (ASBC) in Alexandria, VA. A courageous, dynamic, and visionary leader, he is only the eighth pastor in the church’s 220-year history of worshipping Christ while serving humankind. Under Dr. Wesley’s extraordinary leadership, the Alfred Street Baptist Church has grown from 2,500 members to 10,000 members, and 80 active ministries with an emphasis on children’s ministries and missions. Since 2020, Alfred Street Baptist Church, under the guidance and direction of Dr. Wesley through the Tithe-the-Tithe initiative, has donated more than $5.4 million dollars to over 200 organizations.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Known to challenge the mind and inspire the heart, Dr. Wesley is a much sought after speaker for worship services, conferences, and revivals. His preaching became a favorite of former President and Mrs. Barack Obama who worshipped with their family at Alfred Street Baptist Church on several Easter Sundays. “Faith Forward,” his radio broadcast on the Radio/Urban One Network, is one of the most listened to religious broadcasts in the Washington, DC area and his sermons on YouTube have more than 100 million views.</p>
